## üìù Description
Tomato Rasam | Easy Tomato Rasam Recipe | How to make Tomato Rasam | Quick & Easy Recipes - Are you looking for a Rasam that is delicious enough to be drunk in glasses? Here is my style Tomato Rasam to do just that. I am sharing a detailed recipe with images and a video. South Indians do not feel fulfilled until they eat at least a couple of spoonfuls of Rice with Rasam in every meal. There are so many varieties in Rasam. Tamils make Rasam with virtually every vegetable possible. They have such a huge range of Rasams. I am sharing a simple recipe for Tomatoes Rasam that everyone can make. I make a blend of Andhra and Tamil styles and that is what I am sharing. This Tomato Rasam tastes great when eaten in hot Rice with Ghee. And goes well with meat fry curries too. Before you make this Rasam, it is important to follow these tips:

## üí° Tips
- Ripe Red Tomatoes are a must for this Rasam. If you use hybrid Tomatoes, then you need to add a little more Tamarind juice for sourness.
- Tomatoes taste better if mashed with hand and paste extracted rather than ground to a paste in a mixie. If you grind them in a mixie, the skin also gets mixed into the paste. That does not taste very good. But if you like that, you could use the mixie.
- The Green Chillies in Rasam can be cooked until they become soft.
- The Pepper and Garlic paste that we add to the Rasam should be boiled only once. If it boils too much, the pepper loses its strong taste.
- The Tamarind juice we add may be adjusted depending on the sourness of the Tomatoes.
- Rock Salt tastes better than soft (Iodised) Salt
- Those who don‚Äôt like Garlic can drop it.

## üßÇ Ingredients

## üç≥ Instructions
