## üìù Description
Andhra-Style Sambar | Pappu Charu Recipe | Dal Rasam | How to make Sambar - The Andhra-Style Sambar may have just a few ingredients but has an explosive taste. Here is the detailed recipe for Andhra Style Sambar with images and a video. (Pappu Charu as it is called in Telugu is a combination of Pappu - Dal and Charu - Rasam. A mixture of this is the Andhra style Sambar) This Telugu dish is so delicious when made right that it can actually be poured in a glass and drunk up. It is a simple recipe and does not have too many ingredients like the regular Sambar. The simple yet delicious recipe is an ever popular dish. It is made at least twice a week in Telugu households, The right taste is in the way it is cooked and the measure of ingredients.

## üí° Tips
- This Andhra style Sambar is in fact fully in my style. I have added Drumsticks, Coriander Powder also to this Sambar. That gives a lot of taste and aroma to the Sambar. But, usually, Coriander Powder is not added to the Sambar.
- If you add Jaggery at the end, all the flavours get balanced. Those who do not like it can skip it. And it is always better to mash Dal with a ladle rather than blending it in mixie.
- Usually, Water can be added to Sambar without measurement. But for this Andhra style Sambar, do not add more than 300ml. Only then the Sambar is thick and tasty. Or it becomes too dilute and does not taste good.
- I am boiling this Sambar in a stone vessel. There is just no comparison to Sambar cooked in the stone pan and in a normal pan. The more the Sambar is boiled in a stone vessel, the greater the taste. And the cooked food stays fresh for at least 4-5 hours. They do not get spoiled too soon. But those who do not have stone vessels can cook in normal vessels.
