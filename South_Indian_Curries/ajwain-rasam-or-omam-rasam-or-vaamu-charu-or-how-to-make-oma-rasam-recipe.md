## üìù Description
Ajwain Rasam | Omam Rasam | Vaamu Charu | How to make Oma Rasam Recipe| Vamu Charu | Vammu Rasam - Ajwain Rasam is made with a lot of fondness in Telugu states. Ajwain Rasam is very healthy and anyone, right from a child to an elderly person, can have it at any time of the day. It can be eaten both with Rice and Idly. Indigestion or stomach upset, Rice eaten with Ajwain Rasam will remove the irritants and aggravations from the stomach and set the digestion right. If you eat a little Rice with this Rasam after eating non-veg food, the food gets digested easily and leaves you light. It can be taken in like Tea to get relief from the discomfort caused by the common cold. This is my grandmother‚Äôs recipe. She often made this Rasam and the day we made non-veg at home, Rasam or Ajwain Rasam was made without fail.

## üí° Tips
- If the Ajwain even a little in excess, the Rasam becomes too strong and won‚Äôt taste good. So please follow the measures I have suggested.
- If by mistake, the Rasam becomes too strong, add some Salt and Sour and balance it.
- This Rasam should be pungent, not spicy. So use Red Chillies in moderation.
