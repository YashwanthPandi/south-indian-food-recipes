## üìù Description
Moong Dal Sambar | Pesarapappu Pulusu | Easy Moong Dal Sambar Recipe | How to make Moongdal Sambar- The Split Green Gram is an Andhra style Sambar that everyone from toddlers to the elderly eats with relish. This simple recipe is always a super hit. Here is a detailed video with images and a video. Maybe there is hardly a household in South India where some kind of Sambar/rasam is not made. The recipes vary from region to caste to religion. One of those hundreds of varieties is this Andhra Style Split Green Gram Rasam. Telugus call it Pesara Kattu, or Green Gram stew. This Rasam is a simple recipe with Split Green Gram and Lemon juice. The difference is this recipe doesn‚Äôt have Tamarind like other Sambars & rasam but has Lemon Juice. In summers and those times when everything seems tasteless, or you want to eat something light, this is a great choice. It can be eaten with hot Rice and Ghee, idli and dosa.

## üí° Tips
- Usually, people wash and cook Split Green Gram. I roast it a little before cooking it to a soft paste. Roasting gives it a terrific flavour. If you do not have time, then you can wash and use it.
- The spice that Green Chillies give adds a nice flavor to this recipe than adding Red Mirchi powder. If you like, you can add ginger pieces too.
- Some people add Ghee seasoning, and you can, if you like it.
- I have used the small Sambar Onions. But even sliced Onions are fine.
