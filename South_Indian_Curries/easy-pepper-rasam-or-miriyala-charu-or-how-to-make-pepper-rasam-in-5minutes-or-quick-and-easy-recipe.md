## 📝 Description
Easy Pepper Rasam | Miriyala Charu | How to make Pepper Rasam in 5minutes | Quick and Easy Recipe- How to make the perfect and easy Pepper Rasam in just 5 minutes? Just follow these tips and measurements. Here is a step-by-step recipe with images and a video. Pepper Rasam is a must make in almost every household in South India. But the taste changes with the region. I am posting Andhra-style Watery Pepper Rasam. This can be made in just 5 minutes. Eat it with Potato, Colocasia or Banana Fries. Or it tastes good even with Chicken and Mutton fry. Like I said before, the taste of Rasam keeps changing from person to person and from place to place. I am giving a very simple recipe. It is very watery. Usually, they add cooked Moong Dal or Red Gram to enhance taste or make it easy to mix, but I am not adding anything. You could if you like. But check Salt, Sour taste and add some more. People from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and those from the Konaseema coastal area of Andhra add some Jaggery to Rasam. I haven't, but you can add if you like.

## 💡 Tips
- Rasam tastes better if Pepper, Garlic and Cumin Seeds are pounded by hand rather than ground in a mixie.
- Rasam gets a better flavour if Curry leaves and Green Coriander are added along with the stalks.
- Rasam should be removed from fire after it boils once. Too much boiling takes away its fragrance.
- Before you remove the Rasam from the fire, remember to taste it to ensure that Salt is right.

## 🧂 Ingredients
- 1 tbsp Pepper
- 10 - 12 Garlic
- 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
- 600 ml Juice of Tamarind (Extracted from a Lemon sized Tamarind ball)
