## üìù Description
Mango Ginger Rasam | Rasam recipe | Ginger rasam | Allam Charu recipe- Whatever the number of dishes in a meal, South Indians are not appeased until they get a few mouthfuls of Rice with Rasam.

## üí° Tips
- Please follow the quantity I have indicated as the excess of Mango Ginger can make the Rasam too strong.

- If you add a little Jaggery, it balances the pungent and sour flavours of Mango Ginger.
