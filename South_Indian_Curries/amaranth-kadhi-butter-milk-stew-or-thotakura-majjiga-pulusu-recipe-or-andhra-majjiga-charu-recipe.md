## üìù Description
Amaranth Kadhi (Butter Milk Stew) | Thotakura Majjiga Pulusu Recipe | Andhra Majjiga Charu Recipe - It is a quick-to-make, simple recipe from Andhra Pradesh. I love this recipe. Butter Milk Stew is made in various forms across the country. Northerners call it Kadhi and in South India, especially in Andhra, it is called Majjiga Rasam. It is Mor Kozhambu in Tamil. But it is Telugus who make Raitas and Chutneys with Curd, adding a whole variety of vegetables. This is one of those interesting recipes. Make this instead of your regular Rasam or Sambar, and it is not just a delicious dish but you eat healthy too. We make this a lot at my place. Add just a fry and a Chutney to the Butter Milk Stew and you have a complete meal. A few more healthy Raitas: Instead of Thotakura as Amaranth leaves are known in Telugu, you can use tender Amaranth shoots, Malabar Spinach, Cabbage, Drum Sticks, Ash Gourd, Radish, Radish Leaves and Cauliflower florets for the Stew. Each one has a distinct taste and a specific benefit.

## üí° Tips
- I have used Garlic in this recipe. But you can dispense with it if you do not like the taste.
- Use a generous amount of Ginger to make Amaranth Kadhi taste even better. But you can reduce the measure if you do not like it. And green chillies add better flavour than red mirchi powder.
- People usually say that Fenugreek seeds are bitter and ask me if they can skip the. But I suggest that Fenugreek Seeds are good and add aroma to the dish if they are first added to the Oil, are allowed to roast a little and then add Mustard seeds and the rest of the seasoning, Fenugreek Seeds are bitter if they're not properly roasted.
- Do no add hot Amaranth leaves to the Curd. It breaks up the Curd. Cool the leaves first and then add them.
