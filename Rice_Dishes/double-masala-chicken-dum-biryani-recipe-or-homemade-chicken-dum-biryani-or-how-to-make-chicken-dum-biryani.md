Double Masala Chicken Dum Biryani Recipe | Homemade chicken Dum Biryani | How to make Chicken Dum Biryani - Are you looking for a spicy and delicious Chicken Biryani/ Then try my style, ‚ÄúHyderabadi Double Masala Chicken Dum Biryani‚Äù.It always turns out perfect, and here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. Biryani lovers find Chicken Dum Biryani a feast. And should we even mention the world-famous Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani? There may be many kinds of Biryani but the spice, sourness, aroma and taste of the Hyderabadi Biryani are special. Add the Telugu spice to the Nizam Biryani, and then you get the very special Hyderabadi Biryani. Hyderabadi Biryani is spicier than the other Biryanis, but it is not enough to have the spices that are cooked along with the Chicken. When it comes to the plate, the spice is not felt. Some of the Rice will remain white. That is why they add Mirchi ka Salan and satisfy themselves. But this Double Masala Chicken Biryani will ensure that everyone gets the spice. When you go to a restaurant, unless you order a ‚ÄúChicken Biryani with Double Masala‚Äù, you do not get enough Masala. Even that is served separately instead of the one cooked with the Chicken. So, it is not all that tasty. In this recipe, I am sharing Chicken Dum Biryani with Double Masala. Please do not think Double Masala Biryani is a new recipe. It is almost like Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, but there is just the variation in balancing the spices and how the Dum is done. If you want lesser spice, take a look at the Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani. Try this, Aavakaya Chicken Biryani

## üí° Tips
- The Chicken needs to be coated well with the chick, and it should be allowed to marinate overnight in the fridge, then it absorbs the Masalas and becomes very tasty.
- If there is no time to keep it overnight in the fridge, then coat it with Masals and keep it outside or in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
- Though Double Masala Biryani should be spicy, it should be savoury to eat. The spice needs to be balanced with Curd, fresh cream or Milk Cream and Lemon Juice.
- Boiling Water should be added to the Double Masala or the spices will burn at the time of Dum.
- Before you coat the Chicken, squeeze Onions hard until they give out juice and mix. Only then the essence of the Spices get into the Chicken. Ghee- Oil:
- Biryani needs substantial Ghee; only then it tastes good. People sometimes tell me they made it just like I told them, but it still wasn‚Äôt tasty. That happens because they usually do not add as much Ghee Oil and Spices as I have suggested.
- Biryani tastes better if you use Oil that is remaining from frying the Onions rather than regular Oil.
- Dried Rose Petals give a special taste. Add Rose Water that is used in cosmetics if you do not have Rose petals.
- Usually, by the measure, when I make Chicken Dum Biryani for four people. I usually advise Dum for 8 minutes on a high flame and 7 minutes on a low flame and then leave it for 20 minutes. But it would help if you cooked on high flame until steam gushes out of this Double Masala Chicken Dum Biryani. And if you cook on four sides for 2 minutes each on the sim, the Masala will cook without burning. I got a lot of steam within 16 minutes.
- After cooking the Biryani, if you keep the vessel on the ground for Dum, the ground sucks up all the heat. Then the cooking that has to happen on Dum won‚Äôt happen well. That is why the Biryani should be left on the stove after switched off or keep the vessel on a stand.
- The Salt you add at the time of the Water boiling is what will be added to the Rice. That is why you should add more Salt to the water. If you taste that water, it should be as salty as seawater. If the Salt is not corrected at that time, then you cannot add Salt to the Biryani as it won‚Äôt get mixed.
- Basmati Rice should be added to the Boiling Water and cook on a high flame for up to 60%. 60% means the grain should be cooked half and should still have a dry element. You will know it when you check it under your teeth.
- The 60% cooked Rice should be spread on the Chicken. If you cook for another 5 minutes on a high flame, it cooks to 70%. Add that layer to the 60% Rice. Cook for another 3-4 minutes up to 80% and add it as the last layer. Biryani is fluffy only if you cook in layers like this.
- Before you add Cooked Rice to the Chicken, it is essential that you wipe away the Spices from the vessel's edges. Or the Spices will burn at the time of Dum.
