## üìù Description
Salty Rice Balls | Healthy Snack Uppuu Undalu Recipe | How to make Salty Rice Balls - Do you want a healthier option of a snack instead of chips? Then Salty Rice Balls are the perfect snack. I am usually asked to suggest healthy snacks for children but it is difficult to make exclusive recipes for children and adults. So I don‚Äôt usually specify that this is for kids and this is for adults. I just say it is suitable for everyone and children and adults alike eat it with relish. These Salty Rice Balls are made all over South India but each region has its own variation. Telugus make Uppindi. Tamils make Kolukatai. The Telugu recipe is pretty close to Salty Rice Balls but it looks and tastes completely different. Older generations and Andhras living close to the Tamil Nadu border are still making these Salty Rice Balls. Telugus make it with sour, thin Buttermilk. But I am making it with water the way older generation Tamils did. There are a few tips to make this healthy recipe in a perfect way whenever you make it.
