## üìù Description
Raw Jackfruit Biryani Recipe | Easy Kathal Biryani | Panasakaya Biryani - Jackfruit Biryani is a beautiful recipe for parties, special days and it is a special wedding recipe. Jackfruit Biryani is unique and here is a detailed recipe with images and video. Jackfruit biryani is a Tamil Nadu wedding special recipe. It travelled to Andhra and came with a few changes along the way. I am making the Tamil Nadu version of the recipe. I had first eaten this Biryani when I attended a wedding in Chennai. That fragrance and taste made me eat again and again. And I never forgot that taste. I had subsequently tasted this recipe in Andhra weddings too. It was tasty but not the way it was in Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu-style Jackfruit Biryani, they definitely use the Beans. In Andhra Biryani, there isn't much use of Beans. I am making the Tamil Nadu style Biryani right now. If you use the measures I have suggested for this recipe, it may be a little spicy. Those who like lesser spice can reduce the quantity of Cloves, Star Anise, Pepper and Fennel Seeds.

## üí° Tips
- I have used frozen Jackfruit pieces. In summers, you can get raw Jackfruit pieces; After summer, you can find frozen Jackfruit pieces in most supermarkets.
- If you soak the Jackfruit pieces in Buttermilk for 30 minutes before frying, then the details won't turn black.
- Fry the Jackfruit Pieces well but do not mash them in the Oil or they become a paste by the time the Rice is cooked.
- In Tamil Nadu wedding recipes, they use Double Beans soaked overnight. I have done that too. They add great taste to the Biryani.
- If you are not using the Double Beans, reduce the water by half a cup.
