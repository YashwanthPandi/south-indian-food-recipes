## üìù Description
Veg Fried Rice Recipe | How to make fried rice | Homemade Fried Rice | Restaurant Style Veg Fried Rice - The Chinese Fried Rice that is so popular with Indians is, in fact, not real Chinese style Fried Rice. It is an Indo-Chinese version of Fried Rice, which has been modified to suit our tastes in India. Restaurant Veg Fried Rice Recipe is very simple and if you have chopped Vegetables ready, it takes just 5 minutes. The street food-style Fried Rice Recipe is very different from the Restaurant-style Fried Rice Recipe. I will soon share the recipe for the street food-style Fried Rice. Restaurant-style Fried Rice tastes great when accompanied by Manchuria or Tomato ketchup. Before you make this simple Fried Rice Recipe, please follow these tips.

## üí° Tips
- I have used Basmati Rice but you could use Sona Masuri Rice or make it with leftover Rice.
- Put Rice in boiling water and add some Salt, and some Lemon Juice and cook uncovered on a high flame.
- When Rice cooks to 90%, strain the Water and spread on a plate coated with Oil or sieve it and let it cool in air. Then you get fluffy Rice.
- Cooking up to 90% means when you crush a Rice grain, it should still have a little bit of raw crumb left.

- 1/2 cup Carrots thinly chopped

- 1/2 tsp Aromatic Powder
- 1/2 tsp White Pepper
- 1/2 tsp Pepper Powder
