## üìù Description
Every one of us has a special association with Pulihora. A memory of the taste of Pulihora we had tried somewhere. And in South India, there is no auspicious occasion without Pulihora on the menu. Tamarind rice is made in various ways. The taste varies from the hand that makes it to the region to a family. Every kind of Pulihora has its speciality. Tamils make it one way and Telugus another. It has that distinct taste when it is served as a holy offering in temples. I am giving you the recipe of the temple Pulihora. There are also many variations in the way Pulihora is made. There is the Fenugreek one, and the one with Mustard. There is also the quaint Gongura Pulihora and the ones made with Lemon, Limes, raw Mangoes etc. Invariably, there is a difference in the taste of Pulihora made at home and at a temple. There is some magical element that is inherent to the one made at temples. The Prasadam is just a fistful of grains, but it leaves us with such a wonderful feeling. What I am suggesting is perfect measures for such Prasadam style Tamarind Rice. Follow these ingredients in the suggested measure and you will get Pulihora of perfect balance in taste.

## üí° Tips
- For the Temple Tamarind Rice, we need a little more Oil than usual. It tastes better only with Oil. If the Oil is not adequate, it just sticks to our mouth and does not taste good.
- Sesame Oil or Groundnut Oils are best for Tamarind Rice. Those who do not like the flavour of those Oils can use Refined Oil.
- The two seasonings we add to the Rice give it a pleasant aroma since we use Mustard Seeds in both the seasonings, use just a few Seeds each time.
- Quality Turmeric and Old Tamarind give it that lovely golden shade. New Tamarind makes it more yellow and the Old Tamarind makes it look dark red.
- This is Mustard Tamarind Rice. So, it has a strong Mustard flavour and less of the sourness of the Tamarind. Those who do not like the pungent flavour of Mustard Seeds can reduce them accordingly.
- If you add a piece of Ginger while grinding Mustard Seeds, the pungency is reduced a little bit. Or sometimes, it turns out to be too strong and bitter.
- Wash the rice but do not soak. Add two cups of water, cook on high flame for three whistles and switch off the stove. Afterwards, when the steam goes fully out of the rice, mix it gently so that the grains do not break.
