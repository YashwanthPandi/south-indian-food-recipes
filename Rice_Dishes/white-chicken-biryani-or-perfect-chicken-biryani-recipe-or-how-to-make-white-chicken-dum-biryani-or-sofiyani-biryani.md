## üìù Description
White Chicken Biryani | Perfect Chicken Biryani Recipe | How to make White Chicken Dum Biryani | Sofiyani Biryani- Biryani are of many kinds and each Biryani has its own specialty. And this White Chicken Biryani is even more special! Here is a detailed recipe of the aromatic Special Chicken Biryani with images and a video. It is only Biryani that can completely transform a day. I do not know the origins of this White Chicken Biryani but I ate it for the first time in a Goa restaurant. When I enquired about it, the Goa chef said it was a local variety. But Google told me it is was also a Lucknow specialty and another Chef claimed it was a Mumbai special. But wherever it was first made, I ate it in Goa so I will call it a Goa recipe. It is also called a Sofiyani Biryani and it is not spicy like others but has a fragrant, balanced taste. It just melts in your mouth. It is similar to Chicken Biryani and needs Dum too. But the ingredients we use in the Chicken are different. It has less of Mirchi and more of Masalas and Ghee. Follow these tips for a tasty White Chicken Biryani!

## üí° Tips
- For Biryani, Chicken should always have a Biryani Cut. In fact, for Biryanis made in large quantities, Rice and Chicken should be taken in equal quantities. Because I am making it in a small quantity I have taken double the Chicken for the Rice.
- If the Chicken is coated with Masalas and kept in the fridge for two hours, the flavours will seep into the Chicken.
- Basmati Rice should always be of a good brand and older than one year for the Biryani.
- Basmati Rice should always be cooked on a high flame. Only then will it not become a soft paste after Dum. And after dum rice will not stay fluffy.
- Cooking Rice to 60% means the Rice grain should still have a little bit of hard grain.
- If the Salt is more while the Rice is cooked, then the Salt will get nicely absorbed. Later, it is impossible to adjust Salt at any stage. Remember, the boiling Water should be as salty as sea water.

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Add all the ingredients for marinating the Chicken, massage the Chicken well and refrigerate for two hours.
2. Melt Ghee in a pan and add all dry Masalas and roast for 30 seconds. Add the marinated chicken and fry on a high flame until oil separates.
3. Once the Oil surfaces, add 300 ml water, mix and cover and cook for 15 minutes. If you cook on a medium flame for 15 minutes, the gravy thickens. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. Water has to be boiled to cook Rice and add all the ingredients and boil on a high flame.
5. Add Rice to the boiling water and cook on a high flame to 60%. Then the 60% cooked Rice should be spread in two layers in the vessel in which the Biryani has to be cooked.
6. On the 60% cooked Rice, spread the Chicken Curry evenly. Cook the Rice for another five minutes on a high flame to 70%. Spread it as another layer. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Cook for another five minutes to 80%. Spread that at the last evenly in the vessel.
8. Ghee and Oil should be poured together on Biryani Rice. And then add Saffron Milk and the Water that has been used to boil Rice along the edge of the Vessel.
9. Put tissues on the Rice, sprinkle Water, cover, and Dum it on a high flame for 8 minutes and on low flame for 7 minutes. Switch off the stove and leave the Rice to rest for 20 minutes on the stove. After 20 minutes, mix it from the bottom slowly. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
