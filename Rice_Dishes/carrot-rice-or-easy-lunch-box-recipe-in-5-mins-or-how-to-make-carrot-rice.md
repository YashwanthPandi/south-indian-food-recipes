## üìù Description
Carrot Rice | Healthy Carrot Rice Recipe | Easy Lunch Box recipe in 5 mins | Simple Rice Recipes | How to make Carrot Rice - You may have some leftover Rice or you may want some new, special Rice for the lunch box. Choose this Carrot Rice and it is always a super hit. My favorite Carrot Rice is here with images and a video. Carrot Rice is healthy and is done very quickly. Carrot Rice made in my style does not have the Ginger Garlic spice. There is some spice but nothing overwhelming. They tickle your palate when you eat and keep your stomach easy after you finish. This Carrot Rice is aromatic and it is a perfect recipe if you are having guests over for lunch.

## üí° Tips
- It is important that the Rice is fluffy. If you add some Salt to the Rice while cooking, then the Salt gets properly absorbed. Adding later does not make the Salt stick to the Rice.
- The little bit of Sambar Powder we add gives a nice aroma and taste to the Rice.
