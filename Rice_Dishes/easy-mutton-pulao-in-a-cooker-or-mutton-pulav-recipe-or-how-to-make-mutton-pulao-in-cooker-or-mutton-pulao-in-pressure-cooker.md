## üí° Tips
- The Mutton cooks faster if the meat is tender and the Pulao then becomes tastier.
- If the Mutton is washed and marinated in some Water with 2 tsp Salt, then it cooks faster.
- The Water used to cook Mutton will still remain after cooking. Add some more Water adequate for the Rice to cook. It has to be slightly more than the Rice. If I take 1.5 Cups of Rice, we need 2 Cups of Water. This includes the Mutton stock remaining.
- If you are using Sona Masuri Rice, then make it 2.5 Cups of water for 1.5 Cups of Rice. Cook to two whistles and then rest it for 20 minutes after the stove is switched off.
