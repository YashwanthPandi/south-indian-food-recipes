## üìù Description
Egg Fried Rice Recipe | Restaurant Style Egg Fried Rice | How to make Egg Fried Rice | Simple Egg Fried Rice - It is very easy to make Restaurant-style Indo-Chinese Egg Fried Rice. Here is a detailed recipe of the Restaurant- style Egg Fried Rice Recipe. The Chinese Fried Rice that is so popular with Indians is, in fact, not real Chinese style Fried Rice. It is an Indo-Chinese version of Fried Rice, which has been modified to suit our tastes in India. Restaurant Egg Fried Rice Recipe is very simple and if you have chopped Vegetables ready, it takes just 5 minutes. The street food-style Fried Rice Recipe is very different from the Restaurant-style Fried Rice Recipe. I will soon share the recipe for the street food-style Fried Rice. Restaurant-style Egg Fried Rice tastes great when accompanied by Manchuria or Tomato ketchup. Before you make this simple Egg Fried Rice Recipe, please follow these tips.

## üí° Tips
- Put Rice in boiling water and add some Salt, and some Lemon Juice and cook uncovered on a high flame.
- When Rice cooks to 90%, strain the Water and spread on a plate coated with Oil or sieve it and let it cool in air. Then you get fluffy Rice.
- Cooking up to 90% means when you crush a Rice grain, it should still have a little bit of raw crumb left.
- How to get Restaurant taste?: Indo- Chinese recipes should always be tossed on a high flame. Then you get the smoky flavour and Restaurant taste.
- Aromatic Powder: I have used Aromatic Powder instead of Ajinomoto. This is easily available online. Those who cannot find it can use Ajinomoto, also known as tasting salt. Or you can drop them all.
