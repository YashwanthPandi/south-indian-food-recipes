2. Melt Ghee in a pan and add all dry Masalas and roast for 30 seconds. Add the marinated chicken and fry on a high flame until oil separates.
3. Once the Oil surfaces, add 300 ml water, mix and cover and cook for 15 minutes. If you cook on a medium flame for 15 minutes, the gravy thickens. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

5. Add Rice to the boiling water and cook on a high flame to 60%. Then the 60% cooked Rice should be spread in two layers in the vessel in which the Biryani has to be cooked.
6. On the 60% cooked Rice, spread the Chicken Curry evenly. Cook the Rice for another five minutes on a high flame to 70%. Spread it as another layer. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
