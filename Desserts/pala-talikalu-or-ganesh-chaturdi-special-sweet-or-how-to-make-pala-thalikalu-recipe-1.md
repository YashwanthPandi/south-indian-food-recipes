5. Mix milk and water and bring it to boil fully and add Sago pearls which are soaked for 30min in water and let them cook up to half.
6. Once Sago pearls are half cooked, then add prepared Talikalu to Milk and leave it undisturbed for 5 min. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. After 5 min stir it slowly, close the lid and let it boil for 12-15 minutes
8. After 12 min, cut Talikalu with a spoon to check whether they have absorbed Milk. Once it boils to the inner core, mix water and Rice flour which was set aside, to make batter without lumps and add this to Talikalu and boil it for another 5-6 min with the lid closed and in low flame.
9. It becomes thick after 5-6 min, then switch off the stove and add Cardamom powder and cooled jaggery syrup and mix it slowly. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
10. Heat the Ghee and add dry Coconut pieces, Cashew Nuts, Raisins and roast them until they turn golden.
11. Talikalu might appear raw when they are hot. They absorb more Milk once they are cooled.
