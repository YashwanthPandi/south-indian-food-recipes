## 🧂 Ingredients
- 1 cup Bombay Rava/Semolina (250 gms)
- 1/2 cup Grated Raw Coconut
- 3 tbsps Ghee (50 gms)
- 10 - 15 Cashew Nuts
- 10 - 15 Raisins
- 1 cup Sugar (175 gms)
- 100 ml Water
- 3 - 4 Cardamom Powder

## 🍳 Instructions
1. Mix Raw Coconut and Rava and let it rest for 2 hours.
2. Heat Ghee in a pan and fry Cashew Nuts and Raisins, and set them aside.
3. Now add the Rava that has been allowed to rest for 2 hours and roast it on a low flame until it turns light golden. It has to be roasted only on a low flame, and it takes 20 to 25 minutes. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. In another pan, pour Water and Sugar and boil it until you get stringy syrup.
5. Once you get Stringy Syrup, switch off the stove and add the roasted Rava, Cashew Nuts and Raisins and mix well. Let it rest until it becomes lukewarm.
6. The Laddoos have to be rolled while the mixture is still lukewarm or it becomes too dry. Take the lumpy Rava, smash and add Cardamom Powder. Apply some Ghee to your hand, and then roll the Laddoos. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Once they are completely cool, store them in an airtight container. They stay fresh for at least a week.
