## üìù Description
Chocolate Brownie | Caf√© Style Chocolate Brownie Recipe | Best Fudgy Cocoa Brownies - There are many varieties of Brownies. This is a simple basic Chocolate Brownie. This recipe will give you Brownies that are crispy on the top and sides and also moist enough to melt in your mouth. It tastes exactly like the Chocolate Brownies you get in Cafes. Brownies are easy to make if you know the technique. But the measurements should be accurate, and they should be baked at just the right temperature. If you don't get either of these right, then the Brownies will not turn out well. I tried and failed to make good Brownies many times. To tell you honestly, I neither got the taste nor the shape of the original Brownie. But when I had attended a buffet dinner at a star hotel in Hyderabad, I met the baker there and asked him to explain what I was doing wrong. And with the help of tips given by Chef Sushanta, I learned to make perfect Brownies. I am making these Brownies with Eggs. I shall post an Eggless recipe soon.

## üí° Tips
- I have used a 9 x 9-inch mould. You could use a 12 x 12-inch mould for Cafe style Brownies.
- If you keep all the ingredients ready and start preheating the Oven, and then start mixing, the Oven will be ready by the time the mixing is done.
- The Oven starts to cool down once preheating is over. Therefore, the Brownie mould has to be kept inside immediately. Only then we will get perfect Brownies.
- Every Oven works differently. So, it is always better to bake until you poke a toothpick in the centre of the Brownie, and it comes out clean.
- The Chocolate flavour gets emphasized if you add a spoon of Coffee Decoction to the Brownie. I haven't counted but you could try if you like.
- Heat Dark Chocolate for 10 seconds in the Oven, mix and heat for another 10 seconds. Do it again for another 10 seconds, and then it melts nicely for the Brownie.
- If the Chocolate mould is kept directly on the stove, the Chocolate burns. That is why it needs to be melted by a double broiler method or in an open Oven.

5. Sieve Maida and Cocoa Powder together. Use a spatula on the sieved powder is cut & fold method until they are thoroughly mixed.
6. Spread Butter Paper in the mould and pour the chocolate mix into it. Pat gently so that there are no bubbles in the mixture. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Put the cake mould in the preheated mould and bake at 170 degrees for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
8. Let the baked Brownies cool entirely in the mould itself. Once cool, take it out, snip off the edges and cut it into pieces.
9. Brownies taste even more delicious if eaten with Ice Cream. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
