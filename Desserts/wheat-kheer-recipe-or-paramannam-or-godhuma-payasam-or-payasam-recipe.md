## üìù Description
Wheat Kheer recipe | Paramannam | Godhuma payasam | Payasam Recipe - Paramannam or Payasam of South India is composed of the words Payas, which means Milk in Sanskrit, and it is Payasam as Milk is the primary ingredient. And it attains holiness once it is offered to the deity, and hence it is Parama‚Ä¶the highest‚Ä¶Annam, Rice. Paramannam is what the Telugus usually call Kheer. In the South, Kheer is usually made with Rice. I have used Broken Wheat. This is an easy recipe to make for festivals, Pujas and any special occasions. I have made this for Ratha Saptami, which is the Sun festival, and I have included ingredients that Sun God is fond of. This Wheat Kheer has a golden colour and tastes lovely.
