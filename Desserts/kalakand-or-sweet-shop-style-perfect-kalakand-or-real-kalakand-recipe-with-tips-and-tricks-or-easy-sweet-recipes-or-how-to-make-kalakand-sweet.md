## üìù Description
Kalakand | Sweet Shop Style Perfect Kalakand | Real Kalakand Recipe with Tips & Tricks | Easy Sweet Recipes | How to make Kalakand Sweet- All you need is thick Milk and Sugar to make this Sweet shop style Kalakand recipe. Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. The ever-popular Kalakand that we buy in sweet shops can be made easily if you follow my recipe. There are some tips to follow for the perfect Kalakand. Milk : We need only thick Buffalo Milk for this recipe. Only then the Kalakand will taste good. Those who use Packet Milk use the one with a higher percentage of fat. The milk needs to be boiled and kept stirring until Kalakand is ready. If you boil on a low flame, the thickening milk sticks to the bottom and the colour of the Kalakand changes. Unless you keep stirring the Milk until Kalakand forms, a layer of hard cream will form on the surface. Kalakand does not taste good with cream flakes. Before you pour milk into the pam, if you pour some water, then you can prevent to some extent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The Pan: The pan for making Kalakand should be in a ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape and have a deep bottom. Only then it is possible to mix Kalakand without burning it. The pan has to be double the capacity of the quantity of milk. Do not use wooden ladles to mix Kalakand. Steel, flat spoon is the best. Citric Acid ‚Äì Lemon Juice: You can use Lemon Juice or Citric Acid to turn milk into flakes. I have used Citric Acid mixed in Water. How much Lemon Juice or Citric Acid you must use depends on the thickness of the milk. So, it is better to have a little more of those at hand. Ghee: Kalakand does not need any Ghee. The fat in the milk is sufficient for this recipe. Cardamom Powder: Cardamom Powder is not needed as the Kalakand itself will have a pleasant, sweet taste. But if you want, you can add a little.



## üßÇ Ingredients
- 2 liters Thick Milk
- 1/2 cup Sugar
- 2 Pinches Citric Acid
- 1/2 cup Water

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Take a thick bottomed pan and add 1/2 cup Water. Pour thick milk into it and keep stirring until the milk thickens. It is a must to take a thick-bottomed pan.
2. Once the Milk boils, let it simmer for another 15-20 minutes until it thickens. Then add sugar and keep stirring on high flame until the milk thickens.
3. Add Citric Acid to 1/2 cup water and mix well. Set aside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. After the Milk is reduced to half, add the Citric Acid Water little by little and keep mixing.
5. Keep doing it until the milk breaks into flakes. (The quantity of Lemon Juice/Citric Acid depends on the thickness of the milk)
6. It took me 50 minutes to keep stirring until Kalakand came together. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Once it becomes a pearly mass also, Kalakand will still have some Milk in it. Then switch off the stove, remove and spread it to the sides of the pan thinly and let it rest for 40 minutes
8. Then spread Kalakand in a tray coated with Ghee and let it cool. Then it is convenient to cut into pieces.
9. Keep it for 4-5 hours or overnight and then cut into pieces. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
