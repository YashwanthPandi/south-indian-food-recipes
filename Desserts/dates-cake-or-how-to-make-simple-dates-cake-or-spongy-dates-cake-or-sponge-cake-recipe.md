## üìù Description
Dates Cake | How to make simple Dates Cake | Spongy DATES CAKE | Sponge cake recipe| Khajur cake- Are you looking for a cake that feels like silk and tastes like butter? Then this Dates Cake is just for you. Here is a detailed recipe of the Dates cake with images and a video. Who doesn‚Äôt love Cake! And it is so much fun to make them at home. If you have that kind of an interest then make this super easy, super tasty Dates Cake! It tastes great and has very nice flavours. And every time you make it, you get a soft Cake. This Cake is not Eggless. But cakes with Eggs look nice and taste good. When I asked my followers why they keep asking for Eggless recipes, I was told that the cake is soft but it is smelling of Eggs. But this Dates Cake is not like that, it doesn‚Äôt smell of the Eggs at all.

## üí° Tips
- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees for 10 minutes. Keep the Cake tin in the middle rack and bake for 25 minutes. I have used OTG Oven. Those who use OTG Oven should switch on the rods and the fan and then bake.
- The Cake was baked in 25 minutes in my oven. But the time may be more or less depending on the capacity of your oven. So, poke a toothpick in and if it comes out clean, consider your Cake perfectly baked.
- After the Cake is baked, let it cool fully in the tin itself and then de-mold it.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 10 - 12 Ripe Dates
- 175 ml Water (3/4 cup)
- 1 Egg
- 75 gm Sugar (1/3 Cup + 1 tsp)
- 1 tsp Vanilla Essence
- 3/4 cup Maida (90 gm)
- 1 tsp Baking Soda
- 75 gm Butter/Oil (1/3 cup)
- 90 ml Water in which Dates have been boiled

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Add Water to the Dates and cook them well. Strain the cooked ones and make a smooth paste in a mixie. Keep the Water in which you boiled the Dates aside.
2. Add Egg, Sugar and Vanilla Essence to a bowl and beat until frothy. The Sugar has to fully melt and become frothy.
3. Sieve Maida and Baking Soda and add Butter which is at room temperature and whisk them all well. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

5. Apply Butter to a 6 inch Cake tin, spread the Cake dough and pat it 3-4 times until even. Then bake for 25 minutes at 180 degrees for 25 minutes.
6. Take the fully baked cake out of the oven and let it cool in the tin itself. Then de-mold it and cut it into pieces. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
