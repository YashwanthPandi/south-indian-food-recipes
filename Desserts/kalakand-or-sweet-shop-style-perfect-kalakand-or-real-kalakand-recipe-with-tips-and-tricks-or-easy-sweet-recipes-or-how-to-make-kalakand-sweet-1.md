## üßÇ Ingredients
- 2 liters Thick Milk
- 1/2 cup Sugar
- 2 Pinches Citric Acid
- 1/2 cup Water

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Take a thick bottomed pan and add 1/2 cup Water. Pour thick milk into it and keep stirring until the milk thickens. It is a must to take a thick-bottomed pan.
2. Once the Milk boils, let it simmer for another 15-20 minutes until it thickens. Then add sugar and keep stirring on high flame until the milk thickens.
3. Add Citric Acid to 1/2 cup water and mix well. Set aside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. After the Milk is reduced to half, add the Citric Acid Water little by little and keep mixing.
5. Keep doing it until the milk breaks into flakes. (The quantity of Lemon Juice/Citric Acid depends on the thickness of the milk)
6. It took me 50 minutes to keep stirring until Kalakand came together. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Once it becomes a pearly mass also, Kalakand will still have some Milk in it. Then switch off the stove, remove and spread it to the sides of the pan thinly and let it rest for 40 minutes
8. Then spread Kalakand in a tray coated with Ghee and let it cool. Then it is convenient to cut into pieces.
9. Keep it for 4-5 hours or overnight and then cut into pieces. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
