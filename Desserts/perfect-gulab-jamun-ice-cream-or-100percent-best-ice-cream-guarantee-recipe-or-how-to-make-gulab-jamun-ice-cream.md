Often, when we make Ice cream at home, it ends up as a lumpy mass. Sometimes, it looks good, but when you eat it, it just does not taste right. Just follow all the tips I have suggested and make it in my measures, and you will make the best Ice Cream. All you need to know is a small technique and the right ingredients, and you will make the perfect Ice Cream every time you attempt it.

## üí° Tips
- Whipping is very important for Ice Cream. The Ice Cream becomes creamy only because of whipping.
- Use Dairy Whipping Cream only. There is non Dairy Cream available, but please don't use that for the Ice Cream will not come out well.
- Whipping Cream is found in tetra packs and is firm like Ice Cream. Before you use the Whipping Cream, take it out of the freezer and keep it in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Then, it melts a little but will still be cold. Then if you use that cream, you can get a perfect measure. If the Whipping Cream is not cold, then Ice Cream will not become stiff.
- Whipping Cream should be beaten at high speed until stiff peaks rise. Stiff peaks mean if you take out the beater from the cream, the cream on the beating spokes will not fall but stays stiff. That is what is called stiff peaks.
- Whenever we make Ice Cream at home, things that could go wrong is it has too many lumps or it does not freeze uniformly. If you use Liquid Glucose, you can avoid all those issues. And Ice Cream does not melt quickly.
- Liquid Glucose is readily available online.
- Before you use Liquid Glucose, you should take it with a wet spoon. Then it comes off. And if you are taking it with your hand, wet your hand first. Or Liquid Glucose does not come off.
- If you use Liquid Glucose, the best possible Ice Cream is guaranteed. Even if you don't, you can still make Ice Cream. But it won't be so soft and smooth.
- Use thick Milk. Add all ingredients to the Milk and after it boils, let it simmer only for 30 seconds and remove it from fire. Or it becomes too thick.
- When the cooled Milk is mixed in the Whipped Cream, strain the Milk. Then the flakes of cream will not go through, and the Ice Cream will turn out perfect.
- I have used 10 Anguri Gulab Jamun in the Ice Cream. But if you use big Gulab Jamun, it is enough to take four. You could take Kala Jamun too.
