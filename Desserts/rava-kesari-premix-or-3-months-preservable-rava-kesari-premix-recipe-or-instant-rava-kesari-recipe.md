## 📝 Description
Rava Kesari Premix | 3 Months preservable Rava Kesari Premix Recipe | Instant Rava Kesari recipe - Rava Kesari is the Semolina Sweet that South Indian homes make often and truly relish. At festival times and on special occasions, or when you just have the craving for a sweet, this Premix comes handy as you can make Rava Kesari in as much time as it takes to make a cup of Tea. If you make instant Rava Kesari Premix once, it stays fresh for at least four months. There are many instant Premix recipes available in the market, they look pretty authentic, but you do not get the original taste. Try this instant Premix, and you will get a great Rava Kesari in just five minutes. It is beneficial at festival times or when there are sudden guests. It is easy to make instant Rava Kesari Premix but there are some must to follow measures and tips. Semolina/Bombay Rava: Rava should be roasted in Ghee on a low flame until it turns light golden. Only then it tastes delicious. Water: The perfect measurement is to have a cup of water for a cup of Premix Rava. That is to say, always follow 1:1, whatever the quantity. Cardamom Powder: I have mixed the Cardamom Powder in the Premix Powder. You can make the Premix last longer by adding Cardamom powder beforehand. Dry Fruits: I have used Almonds and Raisins. You could use anything you like.

## 💡 Tips
- You should mix Milk Powder and Sugar only after the roasted Rava cools down completely. Or the Sugar melts at the heat from the Rava, and the Premix won’t last.
- Whatever quantity you make, Rava and Sugar should be equal parts. Ghee is half that measure, Milk Powder and dry fruits are half of the Ghee you take.
- Before you use Premix Rava, add ½ tsp Ghee to a pan and heat it. Or Rava becomes lumpy when you add water and mix it.
- It is enough for the Rava just to become hot. If you overheat it, the Sugar will melt and become syrupy.
- I added a pinch of Saffron while the water was boiling for fragrance and colour. You could drop it if you don’t like it.
