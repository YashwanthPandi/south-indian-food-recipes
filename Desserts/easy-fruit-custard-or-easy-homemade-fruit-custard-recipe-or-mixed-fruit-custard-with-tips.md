Easy Fruit Custard | Easy homemade fruit custard recipe | Mixed Fruit Custard with tips - Make the ever-popular Fruit Custard with my simple tips. Here is a detailed recipe of Fruit Custard with images and a video. I sometimes wonder if the taste of the Custard is enhanced during summers. The recipe for Fruit Custard is very simple. Most of us are familiar with it, but if you follow some special tips, you will enjoy it even more. The image of the Custard on a packet of Custard Powder looks really creamy and yummy. But when we make it at home, we don’t get that look. But try my tips and you will get the best Creamy Custard. We can make many kinds of recipes with a Custard base. I will share them later. Please make this Fruit Custard following these tips.

## 💡 Tips
- I have used the Vanilla Custard available readymade. In case you do not have Custard, add some Yellow food color and Vanilla Essence to Corn Flour and mix it with Milk.
- Custard should be boiled until it becomes thick like Buttermilk and removed from fire. Or it becomes even thicker when cool.
- I have used Vanilla Custard but have added some Mixed Fruit Essence. This enhances the flavor of the Custard. If you do not have Mixed Fruit Essence, you could use 5-6 drop of Pineapple Essence or Orange Essence. You could use Vanilla Essence too.
- If you do not add any Essence, the little flavored Custard we mix in so much Milk will have no special taste.
- Usually, Fruits are mixed with Custard and kept in fridge. I have kept the cut Fruits in the refrigerator for an hour and then used them. If they are pre-refrigerated, they taste good.
- I have cut all the Fruits except Banana and Apple and kept them in the fridge. Apple and Banana change color if cut beforehand.
- Any Fruits can be used in the Custard as per the season. But citrus fruits do not taste as good. Many people ask me if they can add Pineapple. But I suggest it is better to use the canned Pineapple slices soaked in Sugar rather than fresh Pineapple.
- Dry Fruits: I have added Cashew Nuts and fresh Dates only. You could also use soaked Figs and Almonds and others.
- I have not mixed the Fruits in Custard but added them layer by layer. It makes the Custard look very pretty.
- I suggest that the set Custard should be kept again in the fridge for an hour and then served. Then it tastes even better.
