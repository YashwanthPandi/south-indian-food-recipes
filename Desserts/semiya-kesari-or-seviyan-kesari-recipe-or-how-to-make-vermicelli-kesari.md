SEMIYA KESARI | Seviyan Kesari Recipe | How to make Vermicelli Kesari- Are you looking for a quick recipe for a sweet? Make this Vermicelli Kesari in my style, and you will always get the same divine taste. The name Kesari reminds us of Rava Kesari, the usual recipe. But this Vermicelli Kesari can be made more easily and quickly than Rava Kesari. I like the Vermicelli Kesari better, so I am sharing my recipe. You could make it for a holy offering or for your own sweet tooth. There is a Muslim version to Vermicelli Kesari too. They make it differently at the time of Ramzan and during Weddings. I will share that recipe some other time.
