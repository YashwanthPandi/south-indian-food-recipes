It is effortless to get silky smooth Kulfi, and it takes hardly 5 minutes to complete the Kulfi Mix. A chef at a bakery had once said to me that the best Kulfi can be made with the original taste and form intact. I did not understand what he meant then but when he explained the science behind his recipe, I was thrilled. Then I followed his formula. If you follow this step-by-step recipe, you would be thrilled too.

## üí° Tips
- If you use metal moulds for Kulfi Mix and then refrigerate the Kulfis, they become nicely frozen. It is better than using plastic moulds.
- Kulfis should be frozen for at least 12 hours or even overnight for them to get set right.
- Once the Kulfi is set, you can poke a stick into it and then keep it in water for just 5 seconds. Then they become loose and come out of the mould. Just pull it out with the stick that you have poked into the Kulfi.
- If you do not have Kulfi moulds, you could put the Mix in a steel box with a cover and freeze it.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 1 cup Lukewarm Milk (250 ml)
- 2 Slices Milk Bread
- 1 cup Condensed Milk
- 1 cup Fresh Cream
- 1 tsp Cardamom Powder
- A pinch of Saffron soaked in Hot Milk
- 1/4 cup Crumbled Almonds and Pista

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Remove the crusts from the Milk Bread. Soak it for 3 minutes in lukewarm milk.
2. Put the soaked Bread in a mixie add the rest of the ingredients and grind into a soft paste.
3. Add crumbled Pista and Almond pieces to Kulfi moulds and fill the moulds with milk. Fix the lid and prop them up in a vessel filled with Rice so that they don't fall sideways. Freeze them for at least 12 hours. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. After 12 hours, poke a stick into it and keep it in water for a few seconds. Then the Kulfis will come out of the mould.
5. Faluda is also very good with the Kulfis.
