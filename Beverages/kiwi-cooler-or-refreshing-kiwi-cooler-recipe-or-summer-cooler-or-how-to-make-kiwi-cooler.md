Here is a quick and easy recipe for Kiwi Cooler with step-by-step images and a video. Kiwi Cooler is a recipe that is done with just a few ingredients and is finished quickly but tastes great. I had tasted this simple Cooler in a Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad. And found it very refreshing. You will really love it.

## üí° Tips
- Kiwi: It is enough to crush the Kiwi to 80%. Do not put it in a mixie or blender.
- Lemon Slices: The thin Lemon slices should be crushed along with Kiwi for the flavors to get really blended.
- This drink tastes great with Sprite. Those who do not like Sprite can mix it with Soda. Those who mix it with Soda should add a little more Sugar. And it can be made with chilled water too.
