## 🍳 Instructions
1. Add Ginger pieces and Salt to Mango Pieces, mix with a dry spoon and let it marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Roast Fenugreek Seeds on a low flame, add ½ tsp of Rock Salt and grind to a powder. (The quantity is too less for the mixie, so I have pounded it by hand)
3. Heat Oil let Mustard Seeds splutter. Switch off the stove and let the Oil turn lukewarm. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
