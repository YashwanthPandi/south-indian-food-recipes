## üìù Description
Wedding Special Instant Mango Pieces Chutney | Instant Mango Pickle Recipe | How to make Mango Pickle - Telugus have a deep, inseparable connection with the Chutney and Mango Pickle. That is why they have a whole variety of Mango Chutney recipes. Newly-made Mango Pickle is a beautiful accompaniment for hot Rice with Ghee. There are many ways to make Mango Chutney and Pickle. This is one of them. This is a must on the menu for weddings that happen in summers in the Telugu States. It tastes excellent with Curd Rice too. This Chutney is not like the (Aavakaya) Mango pickle with Mustard and lasts all through the year. This is just for 2-3 days and another couple of days if you refrigerate it. Even those who love Chutney are wary of eating it in hot summers. Still, this Chutney does not disturb your system as we add Salt and Mirchi only to the extent we use in Curries. And it can be made any time, just like that on a whim. There is no need for me to elaborate on the exquisite taste of the new Mango Chutney. You will eat and relish it without exception. The taste of this Chutney is mainly in the tender pieces of a Mango whose stone is not yet formed. And follow the simple tips that I have given here.

## üí° Tips
- Mango should be very tender, with no seeds formed inside. There is more fibre in the ones that already have the seed formed and does not soften quickly. If there is fibre, we have to wait a couple of days after adding Salt and Mirchi for the Mango pieces to get marinated.
- Wash the Mango, wipe it dry and then cut into thin pieces.
- Add Rock Salt, let the pieces be coated and rest for 30 minutes so that the pieces turn soft. The flavours will be nicely absorbed, and the Chutney will be ready within 2-3 hours.
- I have added Salt to the proportion that I use in Curries. That is enough, and it does not give out too much heat because of Salt's amount.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 300 gms Tender Mango Pieces
- 2 tbsps Ginger Pieces
- 1/2 tsp Fenugreek Seeds
- 1/2 tbsp Rock Salt
- 75 ml Oil
- 1/4 tsp Asafoetida
- 1 tsp Mustard Seeds
- 2.5 tbsps Salt
- 3.5 tbsps Mirchi Powder
- 1 tbsp Lemon Juice

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Add Ginger pieces and Salt to Mango Pieces, mix with a dry spoon and let it marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Roast Fenugreek Seeds on a low flame, add ¬Ω tsp of Rock Salt and grind to a powder. (The quantity is too less for the mixie, so I have pounded it by hand)
3. Heat Oil let Mustard Seeds splutter. Switch off the stove and let the Oil turn lukewarm. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. Add Asafoetida well and then mix in the marinated Mango Pieces, Mirchi Powder, Salt, Lemon juice and Fenugreek Powder.
5. This Chutney should be allowed to rest for at least 2 hours after mixing. And it stays fresh for at least 3 -4 days.
