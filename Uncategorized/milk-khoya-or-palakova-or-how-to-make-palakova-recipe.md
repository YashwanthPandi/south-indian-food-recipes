## üìù Description
Milk Khoya | Palakova | How to make Palakova Recipe - Milk Khoya is made across South India. In Andhra, it has a different method for each area. Each style of Milk Khoya has its own speciality. Some make it red; some like it very sweet. Some make it in flakes, and some others smash it into a soft, butter-like paste. So there are as many varieties of Khoya as there are areas and tastes. Milk Khoya has a long history. Legendary Telugu poet Kavi Samart Srinatha described Milk Khoya in fond terms. And then there are so many film songs, dialogues and poems about this wonderfully sweet dish. Ayurveda says those suffering from Migraine can take two spoons of Milk Khoya before sunrise and eliminate the debilitating pain. It is easy to make Milk Khoya, but you need a little bit of patience. It is better to read and understand the tips before you start off!

## üí° Tips
- To make Khoya from one litre of Milk, you need a pan that can hold three litres of Milk.
- For Khoya making, thick, U-shaped iron pans or non-stick pans are better.
- Flat spoons that we use for Dosas are best to stir Milk. If you use spoons that you use for Curries, the Milk sometimes gets spoilt.
- After you pour Milk in a pan, while it boils on a high flame, you have to keep stirring. If you don‚Äôt Cream will form on Milk and that Milk Cream does not melt into Khoya. It remains flaky and affects the taste of Khoya. But if you use Desi Cow Milk, even though some little Cream forms, it is tender and soft and gets dissolved in the Milk. The problem with Buffalo Milk is that the Cream is thick and it won‚Äôt get dissolved.
- This Milk Khoya does not need Ghee or any other fat. The boiled Milk has a lot of fat and is sufficient to make Khoya.
