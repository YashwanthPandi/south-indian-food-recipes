## üìù Description
Mango Kadhli | Mambazha Pulisserry Recipe | Mambalam Pulisseri | Mango Buttermilk Stew - This is a summer special recipe for a delicious Mango Buttermilk Stew made in Kerala style. Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. Pulisseri is nothing but Buttermilk Stew which is called Kadi in north India. Kerala has many kinds of nice Pulisseris but this Mango Pulissery is a must taste, especially in summers. Telugus anyway like to eat Mangoes with Curd Rice. This is also similar but has six different tastes. A meal that is finished with this Mambalam Pulissery is a fully satisfying, happy meal.

## üí° Tips
- Squeeze the juice of the Mangoes. Leave the juice that is sticking to the seed.
- Add Salt and Mirchi as per the sweetness of th Mango. As a matter of fact, this Puliserri has a balanced taste.
- As the Mango I had was very sweet, I added the juice of ¬Ω a lemon. But this is completely optional. If you do not like sour taste or the Curd is too sour, Lemon Juice is not needed.
- When the Curd is added, the flame should be totally reduced and you should keep stirring until the Curd totally dissolves in the Puliserri mixture. Then the curd won't break up into flakes.
