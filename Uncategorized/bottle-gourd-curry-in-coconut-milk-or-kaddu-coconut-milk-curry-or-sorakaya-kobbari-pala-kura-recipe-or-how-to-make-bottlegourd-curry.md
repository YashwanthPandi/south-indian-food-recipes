Bottle Gourd in Coconut Milk has a nice balanced taste and is easy on the stomach. Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. I was inspired by the Avial made in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and have designed this Bottle Gourd Curry with a few changes. Folks at my place love this recipe and it hardly takes any time to make it.
