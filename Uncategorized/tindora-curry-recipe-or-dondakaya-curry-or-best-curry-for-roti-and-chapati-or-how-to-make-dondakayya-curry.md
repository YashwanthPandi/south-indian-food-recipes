## 📝 Description
Tindora Curry recipe | Dondakaya curry | Best Curry for Roti & Chapati | How to make Dondakayya Curry- Want to turn the daily Curry into a special one? Then try this Andhra Style “Ivy Gourd Curry’. Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. The Curry, Fry and Chutney we make with Ivy Gourd are familiar to everyone. But this is a different kind of recipe and tastes so good that you would want to make it every day. There is no need for either Onions or Garlic for this Gourd Curry. I have not used them as they do not go very well with this recipe. But if you feel they are a must, then you could add them. More than anything else, this Curry can be made in an instant.

## 💡 Tips
- Ivy Gourds should be tender for the Curry to taste good.
- Ivy Gourds should be cooked in a pressure cooker on a high flame and with just one whistle. Then switch off the stove, or the pieces become too soft and shapeless.
- Raw Coconut Spice adds excellent taste to this Ivy Gourd Curry. Dry, desiccated Coconut does not taste that good.
- The little bit of Jaggery that we add at the very end balances the Salt, Sour and Sweet tastes and gives a uniform taste. But skip if you don’t like it.
