## üìù Description
Tomato Bath | Perfect Tomato Bath Recipe | How to make Tomato Bhath - This recipe is called Tomato Baath in Andhra Pradesh, Khichdi in Tamil Nadu. In Karnataka, it is not the Rava recipe but the Rice recipe that is called Tomato Baath. What I have here is the Andhra Special Tomato Baath. In a way, this is nothing but Tomato Upma. Tomato bath his is served as Tiffin in Andhra weddings too. When they add diced Tomatoes to Bombay Rava, I love it so much that I could eat it every day. Usually, many people get irritated with the mention of Upma. But the same people would not mind eating it every day if it is made the right way with the right measures. This Tomato Baath is that good too. And it is perfect for lunch boxes. Team this Tomato Baath with Spicy Gram Powder or Bengal Gram Chutney, and it tastes just superb.
