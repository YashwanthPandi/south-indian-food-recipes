## üìù Description
Chicken Malai Kofta | Shahi Chicken Kofta recipe | How to make Malai Chicken Kofta Curry - This is perfect for parties and weekends. Here is a detailed recipe for Shahi Chicken Malai Kofta Curry with images and a video. Malai Chicken Kofta Curry melts like Butter in the mouth and tastes very good with Rotis, Naan and Chapatis. Everyone loves the restaurant-style Malai Kofta. But restaurants have changed the Kofta recipe to cater to different palates. The Nawabi style Kofta has a balanced taste with mild spice. The same Kofta can also be turned spicy by adding more Turmeric, Salt, Garam Masada and Mirchi. The Spicy Malai Kofta goes well with Pulao. I am now making the savoury Chicken Malai Kofta. I have made small changes to the Malai Kofta recipe. This is a mild, less spicy, savoury dish but do follow the tips to know how to make it spicier.

## üí° Tips
- I have ground Boneless Chicken to a smooth paste in a mixie for the Kofta.
- As I mentioned before, I am making this Curry in Shahi style with less spice. If you want spice, you could add some Mirchi, Turmeric and more chopped Green Chillies.
- You should add just a little Oil while making Koftas. Or the balls won't stay in shape.
- When you put the Koftas into the Oil in the pan, do not touch them for a minute. Then if you fry them, slowly turning them over, then they won't crumble. Koftas should always be fried on a medium flame.

- For Kaju paste
- 1/3 cup Cashew Nuts (Soak for 30 minutes)
