## üìù Description
Street Food Style Chilli Chicken | Chilli Chicken | Perfect Chili Chicken Recipe at home - This Street Food Style Chilli Chicken should come to mind the moment you think of parties or starters for special meals. Here is a detailed recipe of the crisp Chilli Chicken with images and a video. "Chilli Chicken" the very name is mouth watering for those who love spicy food. Even for me. And then when it is the Street Food Style recipe, it is a spicy, crunchy, strong snack that you cannot just resist eating. Frankly speaking, the Street Chilli Chicken tastes much better than what we eat in Indo-Chinese restaurants with Chopsticks and forks. The Street version has the right amount of Spice that we like. The main difference between Indo-Chinese Chilli Chicken and Street Food Chilli Chicken is the use of spices and Sauces. Is that all , you may ask but the ingredients make a lot of difference. There is no particular way to make Street Food and ingredients and measures vary but whatever the combination Street Food still tastes great. I have posted a lot of Street Food recipes before too. Please check them out.
