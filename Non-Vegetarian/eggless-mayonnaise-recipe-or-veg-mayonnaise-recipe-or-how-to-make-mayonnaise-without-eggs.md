Enjoy a great Eggless Mayonnaise. It is effortless to make Mayonnaise. And can make it with ingredients available at home. Many followers have been asking me for a long time to post a Mayo recipe. I knew Mayo with Eggs only. I did not realize that I could make an eggless version. But I have learned how to make the perfect Eggless recipe and am posting now. It is effortless to make this recipe. But some steps have to be followed strictly. Only then will the Mayonnaise turn out well. And this can be made without any preservatives. Mayonnaise goes well with any Starters, Burgers, Rolls, Salads and a lot more things. Mayonnaise is called Mayo in shot. If this is stored in an airtight container and refrigerated, it will stay fresh for more than a month. Milk: Milk should be very thick and refrigerated. Only then, we get a thick, buttery consistency. I have used Milk from a packet and used thick, Raw Milk. You can use thick, unboiled Pasteurized Milk too. If it is fresh Milk, boil it, let it cool and use it without Cream. High-Speed Blender: We need a high-speed Blender for Mayonnaise. In case you do not have a Blender, use a Mixie. Dijon Mustard: It is mandatory to use Dijon Mustard, available readymade in the market, in Mayonnaise. You could alternately use Yellow Mustard Powder. In case you do not have either, then use a little powder of the black Mustard seeds you have at home.

## üí° Tips
- Should never run the Blender at high speed at once. If the Blender run at a go, the Mayonnaise gets diluted, and Oil will rise to the surface.
- The Blender should be run for 30 seconds, stopped, some Oil added and run again.
- If for some reason, the Oil comes to the surface of the Mayonnaise, add some Vinegar and run again on high speed until it thickens again.
- If you find the Mayonnaise is a little dilute as soon as it is made, keep it while in the fridge so that it becomes thick.
