## üìù Description
Telangana Style Masala Egg Curry | Egg Gravy Recipe | Thick Masala Egg Gravy Recipe - This Egg curry has a thick Gravy and tastes sour and spicy with Rice. This Masala Egg Stew can be made quickly, even by bachelors. This Egg Stew goes well with Rice, Chapati, Puri, Dosa and any other way.

## üí° Tips
- Sesame Seeds, Groundnuts, Raw Coconut, add thickness to the Gravy for Telangana Style Egg Stew and give a balanced taste. Sesame Seeds, Groundnuts and Coconut, should be roasted on a low fire. Then the Gravy tastes good.
- I have Coconut Powder so I used it. But you can use dried Coconut pieces too.
- Onions should be fried well to make the Gravy tasty.
- Sesame Seeds and Groundnuts should be ground to a smooth paste. Then you get more Gravy.
- Gravy thickens as it cools down. So make it a little dilute while cooking so that the thickness is right after the Gravy cools down too.
- If the Gravy is too thick, add boiling water and bring it to the right consistency.
- If you fry Boiled Eggs on a high flame, they won't splutter while stirring. Or the Eggs will split, and oil will get thrown up.
- If Tamarind is minimum, then the Stew gets one kind of taste. And a different one if you add more. But if you like, you can add more salt and Mirchi Powder.
