## üìù Description
Chicken Haleem | Hyderabadi Chicken Haleem Recipe | How to make Harees at home | How to make Chicken Haleem- The best Haleem that you find on Hyderabad streets in the holy month of Ramzan can actually be made just whenever you feel like it. Here is a detailed recipe for Hyderabad Street ‚ÄúChicken Haleem‚Äù with images and a video. Haleem is made in most Islamic Countries and at many places in India. But Hyderabadi Haleem is very special. Hyderabadi Haleem is spicier than other Haleems and is dripping with Ghee. That is why Haleem lovers testify that this is indeed the best Haleem. In fact, the recipe made with Mutton is what is called Haleem. The recipe with Chicken is called Harees. But very few people even in Muslim families call it Harees. So I am using the term Chicken Haleem. Haleem needs a lot of patience. Only with patience can we make real tasty Haleem at home. In Ramzan month, Muslims need to eat highly proteinous food after they break their fast. That is why they modify the ingredients added to the Haleem.

## üí° Tips
- I have added Oats to the Haleem. You could use Barley, if you like.
- Ghee is a must for Haleem for a nice, balanced taste. I have used the Heritage Brand high aroma Ghee. You could use homemade Ghee too.
- Ghee should be added gradually as you mash the Chicken. Only then the Haleem tastes really good.
