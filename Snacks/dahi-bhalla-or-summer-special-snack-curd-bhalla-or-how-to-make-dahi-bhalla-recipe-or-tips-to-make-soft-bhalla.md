## üìù Description
Dahi Bhalla | Summer Special Snack Curd Bhalla | How to make Dahi Bhalla Recipe | Tips to Make Soft Bhalla| Dahi wada- Do you want to make Dahi Bhalla as soft as those you get from the street-side vendor? Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video to achieve just that. ‚ÄúDahi Bhalla‚Äù is made in different ways in different areas in northern India. In Delhi and Rajasthan, they mostly add Black Gram and Green Gram to make Dahi Bhalla. In Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, it is purely Black Gram that is used. I am making it totally with Black Gram too. I feel that the taste of Dahi Bhalla is greatly enhanced in summers. ‚ÄúDahi Bhalla‚Äù is very similar to the Dahi Vada made with seasoning in South India. But Dahi Bhalla does not have seasoning. And then it has sweet, sour, spicy accompaniments as well as a sprinkling of Sev, Pomegranate seeds, grated Beetroot and some such stuff. I have also shared the recipes here for the Mint Leaves Chutney and Tamarind Chutney served with ‚ÄúDahi Bhalla‚Äù.

## üí° Tips
- The Bhallas are softer if the Black Gram is ground in a grinder than in a mixie.
- I have done a short cut of this recipe. Which is to say that I have added the Black Gram to the Mixie and added cooking soda and beat it well. You can get soft Bhallas like this too. But those who do not like to use Cooking Soda should grind the Gram and then beat it for 5-6 minutes. Then the Bhallas are soft and hollow.
- Mix Sugar in very cold Curd, whisk it smooth and then keep it back in the fridge. And Dahi Bhalla tastes very good if it served again from the fridge.
- The Bhallas should also be soaked in cool water and kept in fridge for two hours.
- Only 70% of the Water must be squeezed out of the Bhallas. If you squeeze them dry, then they absorb the Water from the Curd and the Curd becomes hard like cream.
- Sweet Chutney can be made in many different ways. Some add Dates. But I made it with just Tamarind and Sugar. You could use Jaggery too if you like.
- If the Sweet Chutney is boiled till sticky and refrigerated, it lasts more than two months.
