## üìù Description
Instant Noodles Rolls | How to make Instant Noodles Rolls | Quick and Easy Street Food Recipe - The Noodles Rolls that we eat fondly as street food can now be made easily at home. Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. Rolls are now an across-the-board favourite for Indians and on every street corner you find a cart with Noodles and Rolls. Rolls are making a Roti and adding a stuffing of your liking with some select sauces. The Rolls will come out really well if you follow these tips.

## üí° Tips
- For Roti, I have used both Maida and Wheat Flour. You could use just one of them too. In fact, outside Rotis are made with Maida alone.
- The dough made with Water should be soft and the longer you knead it, the softer the Rotis are.
- The Rotis should be roasted only when the pan is very hot. Put the Roti and roast for just 15 seconds each on both sides. The Rotis become hard if either the pan is not hot enough or they are roasted for too long.
- The Rotis should be covered with a cloth as soon as they are removed from the pan. Only then they stay soft even after cool.
- I have used flavourless Vinegar to marinate the Vegetables, You could use Apple Cider Vinegar too.
- If the Vegetables are soaked for an hour then the sourness in Vinegar gets soaked by them. And the spice of the Chillies gets balanced.
- Do not pour too much water to cook the Noodles. Or they become a soft mass after they cool down.
- When the Noodles are cooked to 90%, remove them from the fire. If they are cooked till all water evaporates, then they become too hard. If they are removed while there is still 10% Water, the water keeps them moist.
- Instant Noodles Tastemaker has Salt. So I have not added Salt and it is not needed also.
