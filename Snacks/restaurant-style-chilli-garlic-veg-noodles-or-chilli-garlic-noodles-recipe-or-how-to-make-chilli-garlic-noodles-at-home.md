## üí° Tips
- Noodles: Use the best quality Noodles for the ultimate taste.
- Noodles should always be cooked only to 80%. If they cook any more, they will become a tangled, broken mess when you toss them.
- Cooking to 80% means the Noodles would be fully cooked, but if you touch them there would still be a little hardness. It should be removed from the fire at that stage. The rest will get cooked before the Noodles cool down.
- After Noodles are cooked, pour a little oil over them and separate them with a fork.
- The Ripe Red Chillies we add to the Noodles make them very tasty; those who do not have ripe chillies can add more dry red chillies.
- I have used Aromatic Powder as a substitute for Ajinomoto. Those who cannot find it can skip it. Or use Ajinomoto if you like it.
