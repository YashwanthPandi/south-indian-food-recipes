## üìù Description
Tasty Sabudana Chivda | Sago Spicy Mixture | Nylon Sabudana Chivda Homemade | Quick & Simple Recipe- Start eating this spicy mixture, and you cannot just stop. This "Sago Spicy Mixture" recipe is trendy. Here is a detailed recipe for this simple snack with images and a video. Sago Spicy Mixture is a crisp, sour, tangy and robust snack. I usually talk about simple recipes. But this recipe is so simple that even those who cannot cook it can make it in an instant.

## üí° Tips
- For this Sago Spicy Mixture, we cannot use the regular Tapioca Sago that we use in Sago Kheer. There is another kind available in the market called "Nylon Sago". That will give us a great recipe. The Tapioca Sago usually absorbs too much Oil.
- Even in Nylon Sago, you should choose the bigger Sago.
- Sago should be added in little quantities in hot Oil and allowed to fry until they swell and rupture. Only then we can be sure that the grain is fried to the core.
- Sago swell as soon as you put them in Oil. If you fry further, they break open. You need to fry till that happens.
- If Oil is very hot, then the Sago will be fried dark golden.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 300 gm Nylon Sago
- 1/2 cup Dry Coconut sliced
- 2 Sprigs Curry Leaves
- 1/4 cup Cashew Nuts
- 1/4 cup Raisins
- 1/2 cup Groundnuts
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1.5 tbsp Sugar
- 3 Sliced Green Chillies
- Oil to fry

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Add a fistful of Sago in hot Oil. Let them swell and rupture. Set the first batch aside. Repeat with the whole quantity of Sago.
2. In the same Oil, add groundnuts, Cashew Nuts, Raisins, Curry Leaves, Green Chillies and dry Coconut and mix in the fried Sago. Let the Sago cool.
3. Add Salt, Sugar and mix well in the Sago. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. This spicy mixture stays fresh for at least 3 days if you store it in an airtight container. If you add Mirchi powder instead of Green Chillies, then the mixture lasts even longer.
