## 📝 Description
Paneer Popcorn recipe | Perfect Paneer Starter | Paneer Snacks | Restaurant Style Paneer Snack Recipe - A perfect starter for parties and special days, here is a detailed recipe for Paneer Popcorn with images and a video. If you have all the ingredients on hand, Paneer Popcorn is as easy to make as a cup of Tea. And it is so tasty that you couldn't just stop eating. This is a Popcorn I have designed, with inspiration from KFC's Chicken Popcorn and is a great, crunchy snack.

## 💡 Tips
- The coating on the Paneer should be hard. When you put it in oil, the layer gets fried crispy. For this, you should ensure that the batter for the coating is a little thick.
- I have used Bread Crumbs for coating on the Flour. Usually, I don't like to use Bread Crumbs. There is a lot of difference between using the crushed crumbs of old Bread we have at home and the readymade Panko Bread Crumbs that we find in the market. Try to get Panko. Or dry old Milk Bread Slices in the sun for 3 hours and until they lose their moisture and become hard. That can be crumbled and used.
- Similarly, I have used Chilli Flakes in his recipe. They are available readymade. In case you cannot find them, take 2 Red Chillies and roast on a stove for 15 seconds and crush it into flakes.
- It is better to keep the Paneer pieces for 10 minutes in the refrigerator after coating with Bread Crumbs. This will ensure that the layer will stay intact even if the batter has been a little thin.
- In hot oil, fry the Paneer pieces on medium flame until they turn golden. They taste good with Tomato Sauce, Mint Mayonnaise or Sweet Chilli sauce.

- 250 gms Paneer
