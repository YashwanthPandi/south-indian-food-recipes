Homemade Paneer Recipe | How to make paneer at home | Best Paneer Recipe - Everyone loves Paneer recipes and there are so many Curries, Sweets and Starters that we can make withPaneer. And for all those recipes, it is better to make healthy Paneer at home. It is a very easy process to make Paneer at home with my tips and you will get perfect Paneer. Paneer is used differently for each recipe. Each Starter is made in a different way. Here is a recipe with step-by-step tips.

## üí° Tips
- To make Paneer, we need thick Milk. The more percentage of fat in Milk, the tastier the Paneer we get.
- Vinegar : I am using flavourless Vinegar. If you like you could use Lemon Juice. But if you use vinegar, the Paneer comes out pristine white
- Vinegar : It is hard to say how much Vinegar is needed for a certain quantity of Milk. Vinegar may be increased or reduced depending on the thickness of the Milk.
- After adding Lemon Juice and Milk splits, do not boil it further or Paneer will become hard .
- Add Vinegar and stir the Milk slowly until it turns flaky.
- If you use a thick bottomed vessel, then Milk with a higher fat percentage will not stick to the bottom. After adding thick Milk, it should be constantly stirred from the bottom or it will stick to the bottom and burn.
- The Water that we get after straining Paneerr can be used as stock in Soups.
- If you want very soft Paneer, put the Paneer in a cotton cloth, hang it on a tap for 2 to 3 hours until the water entirely drains out .
- Put the milk flicks in a white cotton clothes and wash it 2 to 3 times, then the sour taste goes.
- If the Paneer is for Curries, then leave it for 30 minutes. If it is for a Kebab, leave it for more than an hour.
- If thePaneer is stored in an airtight container in a fridge, it stays fresh for 4 to 5 days. Before use, keep it in hot water for 10 minutes. And then cut it for soft pieces
