## üìù Description
Usually, Cluster Beans do not offer much variety by way of recipes. Many people do not like Cluster Beans due to the high percentage of fibre in them. But follow this recipe and people will ask for it. This recipe is very simple. Even bachelors and office-goers can make it quickly. Those who want to add an element of speciality to the daily vegetables will like this recipe.

## üí° Tips
- Cluster Beans: Use only tender Cluster Beans.
- I have cooked the Cluster Beans without removing the fibrous string that lines the Beans. You can remove the string too. But when you cook 80 per cent, if there is no string, the pieces get mashed. That is why I have used them as full Beans.
- Poppy Seeds: Poppy Seeds, known as Khus Khus, are not available in some countries. Roasted Bengal Gram can be a good substitute. But the savoury taste that Poppy Seeds bring is pretty unique.
- After you add Poppy Seeds Masala, you must keep stirring the vegetables or the Masala sticks to the pan.
- Options: You could use the same recipe for Broad Beans and Gherkins(tindora) too.
