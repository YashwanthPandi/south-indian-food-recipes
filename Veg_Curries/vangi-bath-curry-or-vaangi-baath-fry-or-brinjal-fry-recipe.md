## üìù Description
Vangi Bath Curry | Vaangi Baath Fry | Brinjal Rice Recipe|Vankaya Fry - Vaangi is Brinjal. And Baath is a mixture. Karnataka‚Äôs Vaangi Bath is extremely popular. It is an aromatic, spicy dish. It is very amenable for lunch boxes too. The powder that we make for the Curry stays fresh for a week. So, you can simply chop Brinjals and sprinkle this powder and make a curry any time in a jiffy. I won‚Äôt say it is a very special Curry. Usually, for vaangi bath they make the Spice Powder and add it to the Rice. I just added it to the Brinjals, that is all. I am a Telugu and Brinjals, and Gongura (Red Sorrel leaves) are nothing less than a slice of heaven for Telugus. So whenever I come across a new flavor, I start thinking how it goes with Brinjals. That is how I used the Vangi bath Spicy Powder that was left over from making Vaangi Baath Rice to make Vaangi Baath Curry.
