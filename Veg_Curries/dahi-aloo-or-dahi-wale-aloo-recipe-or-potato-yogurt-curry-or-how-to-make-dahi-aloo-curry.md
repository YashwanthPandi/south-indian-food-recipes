## üìù Description
Dahi Aloo | Dahi wale Aloo recipe | Potato Yogurt Curry | How to make Dahi Aloo Curry - This Potatoes in Curd Gravy is perfect for Chapathis and Rice and here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. There are innumerable recipes that can be made with Potatoes. But this Curry is special and it tastes spicy, strong and sour in a thick gravy of Curds. ‚ÄúPotatoes in Curd Gravy‚Äù is a recipe that has many variations across the northern India. And it also tastes different in Dhabas and restaurants. I am making it the way it is done in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This is a simple recipe just follow some tips and you get a perfect Curry.

## üí° Tips
- Potatoes should not be cooked fully. They should be cooked to 80% and then fried. The remaining 20% is done while the Curry is cooked.
- I have used Baby Potatoes but you could cut a big Potato into four or six pieces and use it.
- Potatoes should be fried well in Oil first. Only then does the Curry taste good.
- Black Cumin or Kalonji seeds give a great flavor to the Curry but you can skip it if you don‚Äôt like the taste.
- Before you add whisked Curds, switch off the stove and mix the Curds well in the Curry. Then switch the stove back on and cook on a low flame until the Oil separates. Then the Curd won‚Äôt become flaky.
- There is no need for additional Mirchi Powder if you have Green Chillies and Pepper. But taste the Curry and add if you like more spice.
