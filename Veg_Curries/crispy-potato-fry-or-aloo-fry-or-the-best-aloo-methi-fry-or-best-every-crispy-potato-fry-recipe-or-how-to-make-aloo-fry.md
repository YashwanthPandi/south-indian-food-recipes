It has a mild bitterness and nice Mirchi spice. Some little tips for this simple Potato Fry:

## üí° Tips
- Always use Potatoes that are fresh and have thin skin so that the fry is fresh and crunchy. Use those Potatoes used to make chips.
- Before you fry Potatoes, peel them, dice them and soak them in water for 30 minutes, Then the Potatoes lose their surface starch and come out crunchy when fried.
- If those few Fenugreek Seeds in the fry are roasted red, they give a savoury taste. Or the fry turns bitter. Those who do not like it can skip the Fenugreek Seeds.
- If you like that mild bitterness, add the small Fenugreek leaves. Or use the big leaves.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 1/2 Kg Potatoes
- 1/2 tsp Fenugreek Seeds
- 2 Red Chillies
- 1/2 cup Oil
- 1 cup Chopped Fenugreek Leaves

## üç≥ Instructions
