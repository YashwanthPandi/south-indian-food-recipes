## üìù Description
Kadai Paneer Recipe | Shahi Paneer Recipe | How to make Kadai Paneer Gravy Recipe | Homemade Kadai Paneer Recipe -Homemade Kadai Paneer is popular across the board. Here is a detailed recipe with step-by-step images and a video. Kadai Paneer is a famous Punjabi recipe. It is spicier than most other Punjabi Paneer recipes and tastes very good. This Kadai Paneer recipe is entirely in the homemade style. I am not adding Cashew Nut paste and others as they do in restaurants and am giving a simple recipe. But it does not lag behind the restaurant Curry in either taste or spice. It has thick Gravy and very tasty. And the method is pretty easy too. In restaurant-style Kadai Paneer, they roast the Spices until they turn aromatic, powder them and add them to the Curry. But I am making a Curry that is simple yet tasty. It is a spicy Curry, though, and those who like spice will love it.

## üí° Tips
- Grind the Masala ingredients into a coarse powder.
- The first batch of Onions we add should be chopped into thin slivers and should be fried until golden. The Onion and Capsicum we add later should be broadly chopped like rose petals.
- Capsicum and Onions should be cooked only for two minutes. It is tasty to get the crunchy pieces when you eat the Curry.
- If you add hot water to cook the vegetables, then the flavours of the Spices you add will not get diluted. If you add cold Water, the Spices lose their flavour.
- Paneer becomes soft if it is placed in hot water 10 minutes before it is added to the Curry. And it tastes better too.
- The Ghee that we add at the end gives a nice aroma to the Curry. If you don‚Äôt like Ghee, you can drop it.
