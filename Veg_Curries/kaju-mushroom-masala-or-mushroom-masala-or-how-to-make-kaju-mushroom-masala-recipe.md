## üìù Description
Kaju Mushroom Masala | Mushroom Masala | How to make Kaju Mushroom Masala Recipe- Looking for the best accompaniment for Chapathi, Parota, Naan and Roti? The Spicy Mushroom Cashew|Kaju Curry is the one. It is an ever hit with people. My friends often call me to ask for a dish that is easy to make and works well for a party. And this is one of the curries, I strongly recommend. Any special occasion can be made even more special with this curry. This curry goes well not just with Rotis but also with Baghara Rice and Jeera Rice.

## üí° Tips
- The Tomato-Cashew paste that is used as a base in this curry should be smooth and even without any fragments. Only then we get the best taste. To get a smooth paste, Cashew nuts should be soaked and then ground.
- Onions should be chopped in an even and thin manner and fried well. That gives thickness to the gravy and taste to the curry.
- Cashews and Mushrooms should be fried together. That will keep the Mushrooms from going soggy. To get the perfect fry, first fry the Cashews a little and then add Mushrooms and continue drying until the Cashews turn brown.
- If the Mushrooms are fried too much, they become wafer thin and the curry does not taste all that good.
- Cut the Mushrooms into only two halves. They should not be chopped into too small pieces.
- I add ghee at the very last before taking the curry off the flame. It gives the curry a balanced taste.
- The colour to a curry comes from the ingredients and the way it is fried. I have used Kashmiri Red Mirchi powder along with regular Mirchi powder for this curry. It has a strong flavor as well as a rich colour.
- If you do not have Kashmiri Mirchi powder, use a table spoon of our regular Mirchi Powder.
