Rice Pongal tends to make us a little bit full and lazy but this Millets recipe is easy on the stomach and can be eaten for dinner, lunch and breakfast.

## üí° Tips
- Korralu are Foxtail Millets. They need to be soaked for at least three hours before cooking. Only then will the grain be cooked till the core and be soft.
- Foxtail Millets have a lot of fibre and are Gluten-free. That is why they become hard as the dish cools down. So, ensure that you use more water to boil for cooking.
- Foxtail Millet Pongal is very tasty while hot. It usually gets harder as it cools down but if the grain is soaked at least for 6 hours or overnight, then the cooled dishes also stay soft.
- Those who carry them in their lunch boxes should make it a little dilute so that it gets right by lunch time.
- I have used Ghee in a limited quantity. But, if you like it, you can use more.
- I have used Split Green gram without skin. You can use even whole Gram after soaking them.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 1 cup Foxtail Millets
- 1 cup Split Green Gram
- 1 tsp Pepper
- 2 Sprigs Curry leaves
- 1/4 spoon Asafoetida
- 1 tsp Cumin Seeds
- 10 - 15 Cashew Nuts
- 2 Green Chillies Sliced
- 1/4 cup Ghee
- Salt ‚Äì To taste

## üç≥ Instructions
1. Roast the Green Gram on a low flame until it gives out aroma. Let cool and wash it. (It takes about 15 minutes for the Gram to be roasted until fragrant)
2. Add Foxtail Millets, soaked overnight, Green Gram and Salt, pour 5 Cups of water and cook on medium flame until 4 whistles.
3. After 4 whistles, there would still be some Water in the Pongal. But it will disappear by the time the Pongal cools down. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
4. Heat Ghee and add Cashew Nuts and the rest of the ingredients, fry until they give out good aroma and then add to the Pongal.
