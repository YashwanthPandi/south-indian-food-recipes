Appams / Sojja Appams | Rava Appam | How to make Sooji Appam | Suji Appam Recipe | Quick and Easy Recipes- When you want to have something sweet or want to make a sweet Offering to god, these Rava Appams are a perfect answer. A South Indian special Offering, here is a detailed recipe for Appams with images and a video. ‚ÄúRava Appams‚Äù are made mainly in Karnataka and Andhra in South India. These are also called Sojja Appams. These Rava Appams are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Appams are offered as Prasadam by Andhra people on religious occasions, especially to Lord Hanuman. There are 3-4 ways to make them, and this is one of them. It is very easy to make Appams. Rava and Sugar should be boiled and rolled, and fried. They stay fresh for at least 3-4 days.

## üí° Tips
- When the Appams are put in hot oil, the heavy ones sink to the bottom of the pan and stick to the bottom. They can be detached with a ladle. Do not try to detach them or stir them as soon as they are lodged in oil. They will crumble.
- One way of preventing the sticking is to put a perforated ladle on the hot oil and place the Appams on the ladle. Leave them for 5-6 minutes to fry. Then remove the ladle, and the Appams will thoroughly fry.

## üßÇ Ingredients
- 1 cup Bombay Rava
- 1 cup Sugar
- 1/2 tsp Cardamom Powder
- 1 cup Water

2. Pour a Cup of Water into a vessel and let it boil. Then pour the Rava into boiling Water while stirring so that the Rava does not become lumpy.
3. Once Rava is smoothly mixed, cover and let cook for 3-4 minutes. Then let it cool fully. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
