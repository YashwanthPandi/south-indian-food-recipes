Mysore Masala Dosa Recipe | Crispy Masala Dosa| How to make Perfect Mysore Masala Dosa Batter at home- Do you want to make a perfect, restaurant-style ‚ÄúMysore Masala Dosa‚Äù at home? Here is a detailed recipe with images and a video. Masala Dosa is readily available on street hawkers' carts anywhere in south India. But that is just Masala Dosa, not Mysore Masala Dosa. And they use the same Batter for all the Dosas. Also, for the Masala Dosa, they just put some Potato Curry in the centre and roast it well. The original Mysore Masala Dosa tastes special. And the speciality is in the whole spectrum, right from making the Batter, roasting the Dosa, the Masala paste applied on the Dosa and the Potato Curry. Here is the detailed process along with tips. Try this Manglore Style Spongy Set Dosa and Black Chickpea Dosa

## üí° Tips
- The Batter comes out nice if it is ground in a stone grinding stone than in a mixie. In the mixie, the grains get broken, but in a stone grinder, they get crushed. And Batter from the stone grinder ferments well and gives a rich taste.
- For regular Dosa Batter, it is better to use Ration Rice or Dosa Rice to have some stickiness. But for Mysore Masala Dosa, it is better to use Idly Rice, also known as Uppudu Rice. Then the Dosa is crispy, and the Rice Flakes give softness to the Dosa.
- The longer the Batter is ground, the better it ferments. And the Dosa tastes better.
- Those who use a mixie should add the Gram and Rice little by little and grind to a smooth paste.
- The Batter needs to be fermented for at least 10 hours in summer and 12-16 hours in winters.
- Byadgi chilli should be used for this Masala. Or soak Kashmiri Red Chillies and use those. These are not too spicy like the regular Red Chillies. They have aroma and a nice colour.
- After the Potatoes are added to the Masala, sprinkle a little water. Then the Curry stays soft even after cooling. Or it dries up.
- The thinly chopped Green Chillies we add to the Masala Curry at the very last add a nice flavour, better than adding earlier and frying.
- If you want a crisp Dosa, use cast iron or iron pans. You do not get really crispy Dosas on a non-stick pan.
- While the Dosa is getting roasted, do not lift it off the pan with a flat ladle. If you try to remove it, the Dosa gets separated from the surface and does not roast well.
- Masala Dosa should be roasted by adding Oil to the edges and Ghee/Butter in the Centre. If you want a restaurant-style Dosa, then you need to add ample Oil and Ghee but reduce it if you do not want too much Oil.
