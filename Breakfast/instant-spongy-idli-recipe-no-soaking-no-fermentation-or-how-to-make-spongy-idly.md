## üìù Description
Instant Spongy Idli Recipe(no soaking-no fermentation) | How to make Spongy Idly- Usually, Idli is made by soaking Black Gram and Idli Rava or Rice Rava and grinding them into a batter. That is something everyone knows. But this Idli is made with Rice Rava. They are soft like butter and can be made in a short time.

## üí° Tips
- Rice Rava: Idli comes out well if the Rice Rava is fine. The Rava we get in markets is a little coarse. In case you get the Rava from the market, it is better to run in a mixie and make Rava that is slightly coarser than Bombay Rava(semolina).
- Sour Butter Milk: The Idlis are tasty if the Butter Milk is sour. In case you do not have sour Butter Milk, add some Lemon Juice.
- Thin Rice Flakes: The Thin Rice Flakes should be soaked well in the Buttermilk and become a paste. If necessary, grind them in a mixie.
- Pour the Batter on an Idli stand, keep it in boiling water and steam for 5 minutes on high flame and 2 minutes on a low flame. Rest them for 2 minutes after switching off the stove. Then the Idlis will come out intact.
- These Idli should be eaten while hot.
