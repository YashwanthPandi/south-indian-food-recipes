4. The dough has to be soft. After kneading, cover with a wet cloth and rest for 30 minutes.
5. After 30 minutes, knead again and make it into small balls. Sprinkle flour and roll each one into a Roti.
6. Roast the Rotis on the hot pan, turning after one minute to let each side cook. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
7. Once it looks as if the Roti is done on both sides, place a grill on the flame and fire the Rotis directly until they swell. Turn it and repeat.
8. Add a couple of drops of Ghee and rub while the Rotis are still hot. Then they stay soft.
9. Those who do not want Ghee should keep them enveloped in a soft cotton cloth so that they stay soft for several hours. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
