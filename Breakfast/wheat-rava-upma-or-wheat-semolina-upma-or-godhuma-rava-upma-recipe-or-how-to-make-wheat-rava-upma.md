## üìù Description
Wheat Rava Upma | Wheat Semolina Upma | Godhuma Rava Upma Recipe | How to make Wheat Rava Upma- If you are bored with the routine Wheat Rava(Semolina) Upma, try this version. Here is a detailed recipe of special Wheat Semolina Upma with images and a video. Upma is made at least twice a week in every south Indian home. Sometimes, in South Indian weddings, it is made as a tiffin. Or it is cooked when there are a lot of relatives visiting. Upma can be made with Bombay Rava, Rice Rava, Millet Rava and Wheat Rava too. The other Upmas need some spicy accompaniment. But this Wheat Semolina Upma needs just a spoonful of Sugar, and you can enjoy it. My style of Wheat Semolina Upma is different from others and easy to make.

## üí° Tips
- They often sell Maize Rava in the name of Wheat Semolina in the market so ask for Bansi Rava or Red Wheat Rava (it happens in Telugu states). If you like, you can use Corn Semolina too.
- Upma feels a little bit mushy on heat. But gets set when it cools down.
