## 📝 Description
Curd Idly | Curd Idli | Dahi idli | Thayir Idli | How to Make Curd Idli Recipe | Perugu Idli- Curd Idly is a simple recipe that can be made and eaten regardless of season and reason. It is a super recipe for all times, and here is a detailed recipe of Curd Idly with images and a video. “Curd Idly” is very popular with kids too. I had eaten this Curd Idly for the first time at a wedding in Chennai. I really loved it. And I am sharing that recipe with a few changes here. Curd Idly is very suitable for lunch boxes too. And you can make this recipe from leftover Idlies in the evenings.

## 💡 Tips
- Curd should always be thin in consistency and cool. If you add thick Curd, the Idly soaks up the water in the Curd, and Curd flakes form on the surface of the Idly. So dilute it with water.
- If the leftover Idly is hard, then sprinkle a little water and make them soft. Or the Idly absorbs the water from the Curd and becomes like Halwa.
- I have used Chillies soaked in Buttermilk for the seasoning. You could use Red Chillies.
- I have served with Pomegranate Seeds. You could add Sweet Boondi if you like.

## 🧂 Ingredients
- 7 - 8 Idly
- 1/2 liter Curd
- Salt – To taste
- 1 tbsp Sugar
- For Seasoning
- 1 tbsp Oil
- 1 tsp Mustard Seeds
- 1/2 tsp Cumin Seeds
- 2 Sprigs Curry leaves
- 1 Green Chilli (Chopped)
- Asafoetida – A pinch
- 1 - 2 Chillies soaked in Buttermilk
- 1/4 cup Pomegranate Seeds

## 🍳 Instructions
1. Add Salt and Sugar to cool, dilute Curd and refrigerate for an hour.
2. Heat Oil for Seasoning and fry all the ingredients, and set aside.
3. If the Idlies are cool, then sprinkle some water on them and then pour the Curd mixture on them. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
